  <h3 align="center">Wasted Classification using Mobilenet-V1</h3>

  <p align="justify">
    In Indonesia, waste is a very serious problem. This is evidenced by data obtained from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS) in 2018 where Indonesian people still find it difficult to sort waste and do not know the benefits of discarded waste. Data obtained from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry in 2019 reached 66-67 million tons of waste in Indonesia, which is higher than the previous year's 64 million tons. The percentage of organic waste is 60%, plastic waste reaches 15%. According to research in handling and processing waste is classified into three types, namely namely recycleable, non-organic, and organic waste. Organic and inorganic waste will generally be transported and stockpiled at the Final Disposal Site (TPA). Sorting waste at the TPA will be more difficult to do than sorting a trash can. So far, the only available trash bins are trash bins with manual sorting done by the community. As it is known that currently there are many people who do not understand the different types of waste to be disposed of, so that even though organic and inorganic types of trash have been provided, people still dispose of waste in inappropriate types. This of course will be very inconvenient in the effort to sort waste in the trash where as the first place for garbage to gather. Because of the need for a tool that can help the community in distinguishing the types of waste before putting it into the trash with an accurate classification method Based on the problems in classifying the types of waste that have been described previously, we need a system that is able to classify waste according to its type, The MobileNet V1 architecture is used by researchers to classify images, the models generated by the architecture will then be deployed into mobile-based applications. The dataset used in this study consists of 3 classes, namely N (Non-Recyclable), O (Organic), R (Recyclable) which have been preprocessed into 1500 sample data for each class with a total of 4500 data, which will then be divided into training data, validation data, and testing data, each of which consists of 2880, 720 and 900 sample data. Pretrained model MobileNets-V1 can classify types of waste very well, the best model obtained is a model that uses dropout 0.4 which provides testing accuracy of 91%, training accuracy of 99.58% and validation accuracy of 94.44%.
